For questions as defined in [QUADAS-2](http://annals.org.libproxy.lib.unc.edu/article.aspx?articleid=474994), 

**Random** = Was a consecutive or random sample of patients enrolled?,

**Case-control** = Was a case-control design avoided?,
Exclusion = Did the study avoid inappropriate exclusions?,

**Selection** = Could the selection of patients have introduced bias? (RISK),

**Concern-match** = Are there concerns that the included patients do not match the review question?

**Knowledge-index** = "Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard?",

**Threshold** = If a threshold was used, was it pre-specified?,

**Concern-index** = Is there concern that the index test, it's conduct or interpretation different from the review question (CONCERN)?,

**Reference standard** = Is the reference standard likely to classify the target condition?,

**Knowledge-reference** = Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test?,

**Bias-index** = Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias (RISK)?,

**Reference-match** = Is there concern that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the review question?,

**Interval** = Was there an appropriate interval between index tests and reference standard?,

**Reference-all** = Did all patients receive a reference standard?,

**Reference-same** = Did patients receive the same reference standard?,

**Include-all** = Were all patients included in the analysis?,
Flow = Could the patient flow have introduced bias (RISK)?
